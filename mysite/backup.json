Yet, on Oct. 1, Trump held two more rallies in the state.\\n\\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-house-trump-coronavirus-reports_n_5f8f152bc5b69daf5e16fc0a', 'commentNo': 713114, 'inReplyTo': 0, 'createdAt': '2020-10-21T03:24:17Z', 'boardTitle': 'Current News', 'boardName': '/news/'}", "doc_source": "4chan"}}, {"model": "main.sample_data", "pk": 26, "fields": {"doc_text": "By Oct. 18, the task force reported that 31 states were in the “red zone.” A day later, Trump told campaign staffers on a call, “People are tired of COVID. ...

People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” referring to National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci.\n\nThe task force calls for more testing in all 50 states, contradicting Trump’s claim that he has “done too good a job” on testing. It also urges “red zone” states to put mask mandates in place, as governors in some of those states ignore the recommendations and embrace Trump’s false claims that “there’s a lot of problems with masks” and “85% of the people that wear masks catch it.”\n\n“The White House reports released today show that President Trump’s contempt for science and refusal to lead during this crisis have allowed the coronavirus to surge,” Clyburn said in a statement. “Contrary to his empty claims that the country is ‘rounding the turn,’ more states are now in the ‘red zone’ than ever before. ...

It is not a vaccine according to the standard definition of \\'vaccine\\' and it shouldn\\'t be afforded any of the legal protections nor the public acceptance that \\'vaccines\\' and their manufacturers have been granted.\\nANON 3 RESPONDS:\\nI guess that when Trump made the middle east peace agreement it went right over everyone\\'s head? Don\\'t you people ever read the Bible? Trump fulfilled a prophecy and started a clock that will take us straight into the tribulation and Armageddon!!!\\nHe will break that peace agreement in 3 and a half years and then get ready!\\n3/4 of the world\\'s population will be dead!!!!\\nDownload and watch the documentary called 25 Messianic Signs of Christ Return.\\nPay special attention to who the Bible says makes that peace agreement, it will shock you to your core!!!!\\nEnjoy these last few years and especially get right with God Almighty!!!

Infertility increases.  Mission accomplished.\nSURMISE-  The Wireless Initiative was the greatest stealth weapon ever unleashed on this country by Soertoro.\nSURMISE- WUHAN  was/is  a 5G Beta test that effectively demo’d the capability and efficacy of this weapons system.  It had to be deployed earlier than planned, before it was fully in place globally, though.  Padded numbers and mistreatment of disease in hospitals and MSM are using ensuing fear/panic to enforce lockdowns and totalitarian rule and destruction of economies worldwide.\nKNOWN – Trump (and military) is supporting 5G rollout as well.\nKNOWN – Q says “Panic is necessary”\nQUESTION # 2 -  Why is Trump admin  supporting massive testing for a “virus” that doesn’t exist?

It had to be deployed earlier than planned, before it was fully in place globally, though.

By simple extrapolation, this figure would suggest that the U.S. will easily surpass 100 million new inoculations in the 77 remaining days in Biden’s self-imposed deadline.\" - [https://time.com/5938128/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-biden/](https://time.com/5938128/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-biden/)\\n\\nAgain, stop talking about things you\\'re ignorant of that you get away with, apparently, in the echo chambers, you\\'re in.', 'Time Created (in epoch)': 1614732104, 'Score': 2, 'Subreddit': 'nycCoronavirus', 'SubredditID': 't5_2gwibo', 'LinkID': 't3_lw49no', 'ParentID': 't1_gpg3su9'}", "doc_source": "Reddit"}}, {"model": "main.sample_data", "pk": 737, "fields": {"doc_text": "Here, /u/solaranx - since I imagine you're going to just ignore this now.\n\n[NY times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/health/covid-vaccine-mask.html) - Literally top byline:\n&gt; \"The new vaccines will probably prevent you from getting sick with Covid.

They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask. Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards.\n\n· Almost 100% of known transmissions of corona happen from extended interaction (home, work, public transit) - you are very unlikely to get it from a stranger passing you by the sidewalk or by a grocery aisle - see [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html).\n\n· Cloth masks are ineffective against transmission of COVID-19 through aerosolized respiratory droplets (i.e. smaller droplets &lt;5 μm that remain in the air for hours) and this airborne route of transmission has just been emphasized by many experts to be the most likely primary means of infection. The solutions that would work to address this route are not cloth masks, which can filter only larger droplets (&gt;5 μm), but \"social distancing, limiting interaction indoors, avoiding air recirculation, improved natural and artificial ventilation, and innovative engineering solutions which collect and neutralise aerosols to provide clean air in personal and community spaces\" ([Wilson et al., 2020](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3206)).

I do agree with you that your supplement regime has protected you both prophylacticaly and by building a strong immune system. Like I said, I've been doing the same with the addition of Olive Leaf Extract. I work in healthcare in very close contact with patients and I play music in bistros at night and I'm around a lot of people. (In Florida we have not shut down other then the initial one in March thankfully! We have a great Governor who knows what he's doing vs the poor folks in NY under the pathetic rule of A. Cuomo.
