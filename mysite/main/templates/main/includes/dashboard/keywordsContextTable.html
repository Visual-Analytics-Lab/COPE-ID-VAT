          <td>I work with the vice-president of our companies team. We basically chase contracts from the partners in time for deadlines every month. This vice-president keeps picking on me for no reason. he keeps giving me impossible tasks and then gets angry at it. For example today, he asked me to chase a partner about a contract before deadline. I called the partner and he said he knows nothing about this at it was another persons job (who is on holiday this week). I report back to the vice-president and he says i need to get more details. I say i just called the partner and he says he knows nothing about the deal, what shall i do if he says the same thing as he did 5min ago? The vice-president then starts screaming at me saying he is very cross with me and to call the partner and get information. Cases such as these when there is physically nothing i can do. It feels i get the crap of all his anger. Shall i quit my job? But i am worried in this pandemic how will i be able to support myself? I've been pulling my hair out because of all the stress.</td>

          <td>Business major/English minor. I work at a home remodeling company as an office manager. It's easy work and I don't get paid enough, but it's fine and I don't want to leave in the pandemic. Don't really have any passion for the field, but it's generally interesting. Wouldn't take a whole lot for me to leave.</td>

          <td>I was always against tinder, people ask me still what I think about it and I said I won't use it and I'm not really made for it. Now I'm actually considering it because of the pandemic. What other way to meet anyone? I even talked to my friends and they said "join some society/club" but everything is pretty much closed or cancelled, especially now that we're in full lockdown again. There is no way to meet anyone, especially since a lot of people work from home so it decreases my chances even further. I just don't know if I'll find anyone for me on these apps, and I've always been against them so it'll feel weird trying them out, like I betrayed my beliefs or something. I don't know what to do but I feel like I'm ready for a relationship, just don't have any opportunities to meet people</td>
